The jebait of having only 2 slots and making everyone think it was gonna be a fight between Funky Diddy and Paunline! The absolute madmen did all 3 plus!

This actually makes me curios though on how it looks like in the select screen.

They might change the number of rows to make it not all wonky.

Or they should shun Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina into the void.

HOW.DARE.YOU

She makes no sense

Popular theory is that the furry alts are going to be slotted under Mario and Peach to make room for Pauline and Peachette and the kongs will take up the remaining ? spots

I don't know why it would be the furry alts specifically. It would probably make more sense for Inkling and Villager to have their genders grouped again.
The funniest solution would be to ungroup the Yoshi and Birdo colors, but not the Shy Guy colors.

I would be suprised but not put it past Nintendo if they release the update and there just is another column of characters filled with question marks

So kirby has a chance? 🥹

If you cant beat em, eat em

tbh i think it's time mario kart slowly transitions into the super smash bros route. they're kind of running out of mario characters to add. I mean Kamek??

I could see it. Gives us another 4 spots, so we can finally add Honey Queen, DK Jr, Nabbit, and Rob

They might put the Inklings and Villagers into one slot again, like how they were on the Wii U.

Funky could be a DK skin, as Peachette will likely be

Why would Peachette be a DK skin? ¡loco!

i feel like they might make peachette and funky just costumes

That feels the most likely 
But… this IS Nintendo

One theory is chucking Tanooki Mario and Cat Peach in the Mario and Peach slots as alts, freeing up 2 spaces

... And added Peachette, for some reason. Ah well, if that's the sacrifice we have to make to get the two Kongs and Pauline, then I guess I'll let her be invited as well.

Odd choice, rather Dixie than her tbh

Same, but then again... which character caused the biggest buzz between Peachette and Dixie Kong :p ?

They should've really threw a curveball and added Bowsette

Dixie was pretty cool for us old-timers back then. I have way more nostalgia for her over Pauline

Pauline was there in the first Donkey Kong game :p
She's waaaaaaaaaaaay older than Dixie O_O
Her resurgence since Odyssey gave her the same popularity as Daisy, so ;)

Oh yeah I’m definitely aware, I just have no nostalgia for Pauline for whatever reason lol

I think none of us knew about Pauline until either Mario vs DK Mini-Land Challenge on DS... or Super Mario Odyssey on Switch.
It's similar to how people may have known Impa since The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time... when she was seen in some games before that one ;)

I'd argue that Pauline Odyssey was such a generic 1 off character that to have nostalgia for her seems ridiculous. 
She's a completely new character now, they just tied that new character to an old name.
Especially when the Odyssey version has no story ties to that old game.

Someone hasn't played through Odyssey. The jump up superstar section has a section where you play a version of Donkey Kong, the original. Also Pauline talks about her items, the purse and umbrella and other items that you could get for points in Donkey Kong.
She talks about that game a good amount. I absolutely loved the call backs. 
She was given the makeover first in the Mario vs Donkey kong 
 minis game on Gameboy Advance. Odyssey was the first 3d and mainline game they used her redesign.

Not really an odd choice. She is probably really easy to bring over from Tour, even more so than the others due to her being Peach' model

Yes but still an odd choice bc irrelevant character.

I wanted pixel art DK Jr. Like in Tour for a Super Mario Kart rep and he’d go with the Donkey Kong theme

Sameee I was really pulling for her! D: She deserves just as much love as her male counterparts

Can't wait to see the online scene dominated by our overlord Funky Kong once again

No Flame Runner in this game but there is a Flame Rider, which is close enough.

No it isn't, the flame rider looks NOTHING like our glorious king Bowser

4 characters? In this economy?

Nintendo saw all the favorite speculated last character suggestions and said "we will do it all".

And throw in peachette for good measure too. Though I kind of wish that they would bring king bob-omb from tour instead of her.

yeahhh there were a few better options tbh. i don’t mind peachette though tbh, especially bc i was only expecting 2 more characters lolol

True. They might have just done it because it was the easiest. It is funny now that there are more peaches in Mario kart than Mario himself.

is peachette even a “peach” though? i guess she looks like her but that’s technically toadette right?

We are NOT going down this Crown-based existential rabbit hole AGAIN…

Hate to say it but we are probably going to get an influx of bowsette art again.

She is considered a Toadette alt in Tour, but her model is basically a tweaked Peach model. She does have a really unique voice and animations. So i'd say she is less of a clone than the babies and the metals

It's simple: Peach is also a Toad, using a similar crown powerup. That's why she's the ruler of many other such Toads in the Mushroom Kingdom. She's one of them. We just got informed about it via Toadette's powerup.

Maybe they're saving the other characters for Mario Kart 9

they didn't do fawful or professor e gadd or wart

At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?!

May I see it?

...no.

4 characters Jeremy!? That's insane!

Diddy was expected, but getting both Pauline and Funky AND Peachette is a massive surprise! Also Daisy Circuit my beloved

Playing as Diddy is just going to make me want a new Diddy Kong Racing. Imagine the adventure mode with today’s technology

man I miss Diddy Kong racing. such a great game

I have a feeling next year will be year of DK. This year was insulting though since it was his 40th anniversary and they did nothing. I didn't even see a sale for tropical Freeze. Anyways.. it will also be the 20th anniversary since Donkey Kong came to handheld consoles (OG Gameboy). So probably I'm guessing we will see a new DK game and a new Diddy Kong Racing next year.

zelda: get in line for lack of anniversaries being celebrated

1994: first new DK game in 10 years
2004: first classic DK game in 10 years
2014: last DK game for 10 years
2024: ???

Gah dang. I put more time into that as a kid than I did MK64.

Hold up, daisy circuit you say *panics that will rainbow road might have been ditched for it

Eh it might just be taking the gamecube slot that people were speculating would be a different track

Ugh I accidentally put my reply on the reply talking about Diddy Kong racing facepalms

Whoops I forgot to add star thingy at the end

don't drink and drive, kids

I like how they still include 1 "who tf asked for this" character to preserve tradition lol

Should’ve been Nabbit

People actually wanted Nabbit tho

Yes. I am one of them.

Also one, especially since they are doing Nabbit dirty in Wonder. I'm never going to use him since he makes the game easier.

Then you failed to answer the question

Dixie

Well they did it alongside all 3 characters people really wanted, so it’s acceptable lol

"You want a full on DK character wave? Lol here's that weird Toadette power up. Dixie who?"

This is the way.
The new trombone game fits this vibe as well, but it looks hilarious anyway.

Actually not a new game, despite looking like it was made by Nintendo. It's been out since Sept 2022 on steam

Diddy
Funky
Pauline
Powered-up version of Toadette
One of these things is not like the other. Honestly, why not Dixie to complete it?

For real, nobody asked for funky kong 
Trust me my dad works at Nintendo

So how many versions of peach do we have now?

Five. Peach, baby peach, cat peach, pink gold peach, and now peachette.

This is getting out of hand!

I'd say 4.5... because Peachette is actually Toadette with the Super Crown ;)

🤓

Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches

The Peach game just added like 8 more variants so get ready for MK9 to have Sword Fighter Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, Baker Peach, Ballet Peach, Safari Peach, Gynecologist Peach, and Seasonal Depression Peach

Postpartum Peach

There are now more alternate Peaches in Mario kart 8 than Mario.

Millions. I’m moving to the country so I can eat a lot of them.

Beautiful Peaches!

Peach
Baby Peach
Pink Gold Peach
Peachette

All of them.

The entire Wii squad is now here 😲

which is unfortunate because these baby characters should fuck right off

I like playing as the baby characters though 🙁

No, I don't think anyone should work on tasting babies.

We're really gatekeeping Mario Kart characters, eh?

every once in awhile you should hate on something arbritary

Let them play however they want. Stop policizing how people play games.

Mario Kart is one of the best possible games for really little kids to play, they're a nice addition for when you wanna hand a 3yo the controller with auto accelerate and safe steering turned on.

Imagine being this passionate about characters you're not forced to play in a game directed at children. Time to grow up man.

aye man hope you have a great evening too!

The King is back and he is as beautiful as the day we lost him

I'm hoping for Rainbow Road DS!

I would love rainbow road DS but wii rainbow road is definitely more likely. Hopefully we get DS bowser castle though.

DS Airship Fortress is much more needed, what a stellar track that was!

Definitely agreed. That's a top five track of all time for me.

Everyone’s gonna moan about Daisy circuit being a pick over on r/Mariokart I bet.
But imo it’s one of the best circuits in the franchise :) gorgeous lighting, fun track layout and amazing music :)
And the character additions are all stellar too :)

I buried my hope for Toad‘s Factory long ago since it never came to Tour. 
So with that in mind, I‘m very happy with Dasy‘s Circuit being the last Wii track.

Daisy Circuit is possibly the most underrated track in the series, I’m ecstatic. Can’t wait to hear the music remix.
Everyone on the Mario Kart sub is now sweating bullets because (Potential spoilers) The last Wii slot is heavily assumed to be Rainbow Road, this inclusion doesn’t outright deconfirm it, but it’s questionable now

Tbh if we dont get the last couple rainbow roads in, I'd be a bit dissapointed

No way we're getting all the missing ones, one at most

I'm still upset we haven't gotten a single bowsers castle at all.

They put in 7’s and likely Wii’s because they are the furthest from a remake based on the current trend of bringing back the Rainbow Road’s for Lightning Cup’s last track. SNES in 7, N64 in 8, next game will have GBA.

Except for Peachette. It’s funny, but I would’ve preferred Goombella as a wtf pick.

I would've loved Vivian 💖

I absolutely adore Daisy Circuit and its music. I'm feasting today
Edit: LOL who downvoted this? Sorry, am i supposed to mope because it's not Toad's Factory? Get bent.

What are the odds they'll actually add another bowser castle course? It's insane that there is only one with how many courses there are now.

One of the rumoured tracks for the final wave is a GBA Bowser's Castle course, which I'd be fine with, though I'd love the N64 or GCN ones to come back too.

I thought it was SNES Bowser’s Castle, not GBA

Oh really, well that's one at least.
I just thought it was weird there haven't been more and there are so many rainbow roads, even more ghost courses than bowser.

SNES Bowser Castle 3 was almost guaranteed at some point, but Daisy Circuit came out of nowhere so who even knows anymore.

NEW FUNKY MODE

DAISY CIRCUIT BABYYYYYYYYYYY

Wii’s Star Cup is now all playable in 8 Deluxe!

BABY DAISY CIRCUIT

Funky Kong was the best part of this direct

Absolutely, the saving grace even.

Honestly Peachette was the biggest surprise from the whole direct

Thousand Year Door Rawked my socks off more.

Maybe Peachette means we get Peach Beach? 🙏🏻

This could have been the DK character wave but for some reason they chose Peachette of all available characters over Dixie Kong.

If only peachette was Dixie

Please, I’m begging you, give me Toadsworth

Toadsworth retired until the next Mario baseball game.

Toadsworth and Cranky Kong. Old racers represent!

What a pleasant surprise. Peachette is an interesting choice. Diddy, funky and Pauline were my top three choices, so I’m thrilled.

Sad they didn't say a more specific release date

This is normal for the BCP, an overview trailer like this, then closer to release a full trailer with all 8 tracks and the date.
I’m betting early December.

It's December, same as last year.

I really hope they give the trophies unique models with this final update. It just feels so lame that 16 of the cups have the same model with a different sticker slapped on them.

I'm so glad they added Pauline. Now I just hope that her motorcycle outfit is her sensible mayoral pantsuit from Odyssey

E. Gadd riding a vacuum did not make it, i cry

I was certain it was gonna be a 2 out of 3 between Diddy, Funky and Pauline. 
Luckily we got all 3 of them, which now makes me wonder how they're gonna reorganize the roster to make them all fit. 
Also, Peachette got in before my boy R.O.B. or Honey Queen, I don't know how that makes me feel.

Another Peach version instead of my boy ROB? Smh

This was my main hope as well. DS was the first Mario Kart I personally owned and ROB and Dry Bones were my go to characters. I still play Dry Bones all the time, but man I'd love to get ROB back.

Wheres Bowsette?

I was surprised because I thought we were only supposed to get 2 new characters this wave and 6 new characters in total. We got 1 in wave 4 and 3 in wave 5 so 4 more new characters is exciting. Can't wait for the trailer for all the courses to come.

WHY DID THEY ANNOUNCE 6 CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE

Big surprise to get the top 3 most requested characters. Pretty cool.

Daisy Circuit! Yay, another good one! :D

I'm surprised daisy circuit made it in

Btw there's a luigi deathstare cameo in case you didn't notice

I wish we could've gotten Dixie, but otherwise I really liked most of the character choices. In particular, it's about time Pauline was added to the game. I figured her appearances in these Mario spin-off games would've exploded sooner after Odyssey, but better late than never.

We have to get a New Donk City track now then right?

Dixie Kong: "Am I a joke to you?"

FUNKY!!!

Funky Kong! Everybody moved!!!!

Is it wrong of me to say that I am more excited for the LuigixDaisy statues in HD than the characters themselves?

Wonderful slate of characters. way overdue.

Finally.

I'm so damn happy Pauline is finally back!!

Lol good ol' Luigi death stare in the background.

They wanted to add peachette badly but they know people would get mad for another reskin so they added three fan favorite characters to make it up

I am a little sad Monty isn’t going to be a character since he’s what I play for Mario party and the mobile version of Mario kart. Hopefully they add more characters in the future 🤞🤞

The funky doubters will now face their day of reckoning

did I see peachette... are we a step away from bowsette being a thing?!

Cant tell me this aint a teaser for a new dk country

I still wish we could’ve gotten Shadow Mario. It’s an obscure pick for sure but the GameCube generation was my favourite era of Mario and I’m quietly miffed he has only ever shown up in Toadstool Tour and nothing else since.

The injustices of the past have finally been rectified. Diddy is here. We missed you, buddy.

Shadow drop Bowsette you cowards

DK mountain from double dash is easily the best course. It didn’t make any of the DLC waves??

There's supposed to be at least one, possibly two Double Dash tracks in this wave so it still has a chance. Hoping for it myself.

Peachette getting revealed fourth was literally this clip: https://youtube.com/shorts/30qBEIoasxk?si=XCz5xkODw7svsINg

Nice to see both Diddy and Funky Kong both in
Also nice to see Pauline included from Tour, too
And Peachette? That’s fine, i suppose - not a character i had on mind ever, but eh 🤷🏻
No R.O.B. unfortunately, but not the end of the world
Nice to see Daisy Circuit in, although i think i like Daisy Hills a bit more…
Wonder what the other courses will be…

Hopefully they add at least 1 double dash course

Too bad they added Pauline and Peachette instead of R.O.B and Paratroopa.

Shoulda been a Pianta / Noki resident >> Peachette

All these do characters better be in base 9. Crazy it took 9 years just to get Diddy.

Will they be stacking the five Peachs or just treat them like 5 characters?

Can someone please explain to me all this dlc madness ? I’ve got base cartridge game, what dlc I need to get all the tracks?

Funky Kong has always been my favorite, let's goooooo

I really hope they add more battle courses even if it costs extra.

When does it come out

That's what I'm wondering. They just said "this holiday," which could mean late November (American Thanksgiving and the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season) or even sometime in December.
It'd be kinda fun if it dropped on Christmas Day. Merry Xmas, here are some new Mario Kart tracks and characters!

This announcement reminded that I still haven’t updated for wave 5 LOL

Are there any more characters/courses left that aren't in 8D?  I imagine we'll get another booster pack eventually if not.

I genuinely thought Peachette and the Super Crown were abandoned forever and would never come back, because that's what happened in a similar situation with Erin Esurance.

Friendship ended with donkey kong has ended, now funky kong is my best friend!

Is there a random character/kart/tire/glide option yet? 
Would love to hit one button to go full random! Save me some time instead of closing my eyes and wiggling the stick.

who the absolute hell asked for Peachette. Pauline is a win tho. But where are my Luigi variants :/ now Peach technically has another on top of already three. I know she's Toadette but still.

Isle definio better be in this final wave .. and peachette come on. ?? Horrible choice

Oof they won the direct with Funky Kong & Daisy Circuit tbh
